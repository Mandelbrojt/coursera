# Introduction to Tidyverse  
The process of structuring datasets to facilitate analysis is called "data tidying" by Hadley Wickham.  

Requisites to classify a dataset as tidy:   

1. Each variable forms a column  

2. Each observation forms a row  

3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.  


More information on tidy data can be found at:

``` {r Tidyverse Vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("tidy-data")
```

To use the "tidyverse" commands the package must be installed first and then loaded with:

``` {r Importing the Tidyverse Package, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Importing Data  
### Read CSV  
The difference between the base R read.csv and tidyverse read_csv is the output, this latter results in a "tibble" class object.

### Data Science Cycle  
1. **Import data**  
  Take data stored on a file, database or API and load it into a data frame in R.

2. **Tidy data**  
  Store data in a consistent form. When data is tidy, each column is a variable and each row is an observation.  
  
3. **Transform data**  
  Calculate new variables and summary statistics for observations of interest.   

4. **Visualization**  
  Represent your data in a graphical way to understand your questions.  

5. **Models**  
  It complements visualization and tries to answer questions.  
  
6. **Communicate**  
  Share your results with others.  

7. **Programming**  
  It is a cross-cutting tool that is used in every part of the project.
  
## Tibbles  
A `tibble` is a specialized version of a data frame that is setup to work better with the tidyverse.  

More information on "tibbles" can be found at:  
``` {r Tibble Vignette, eval = FALSE}
vignette("tibble")
```

To coerce a regular data frame into a tibble use:
```{r Tibble coercion, eval= FALSE}
as_tibble(data-frame-name)
```

Create a new tibble from individual vectors  
```{r, Tibble creation}
tibble(
  names = c("Pedro", "Maria", "Natalia"),
  age = c(21, 34, 19),
  profession = c("Cashier", "Nurse", "Accountant")
)
```

Some properties of a `tibble`includes:  
- never changes the type of the inputs,  
- never changes the names of variables,  
- never creates row names.  

Create a `tibble` by transposing its input with `tribble`. Consider that variable names start with `~` and entries are separated by commas.    
```{r tribble}
tribble(
  ~names, ~age, ~profession,
#  -----|-----|------------|
  "Pedro", 21, "Cashier",
  "Maria", 34, "Nurse",
  "Natalia", 19, "Accountant"
)
```

### `tibble` versus  `data.frame`  

#### Printing  

- Tibbles show the first 10 rows and all the columns that fit on screen when printed. To show more results use the `print()`command and specify the number of rows with `n`and the `width`of the display (use Inf to show all columns).  

- Use `View()`to navigate on large tibbles inside R.  

#### Subsetting  

- Extract a variable by name using `$`  

- Extract a variable by name or position using `[[]]`.  

```{r Subsetting Tibbles}
top_cartoons <- tibble(
  cartoon_name = c("Dexter´s Laboratory", "Rugrats", "Hey Arnold!"),
  release_year = c(1996, 1991, 1996)
)

# Extract variable by name
top_cartoons$cartoon_name
top_cartoons[["cartoon_name"]]

# Extract variable by position
top_cartoons[[1]]
```

Subsetting with a `pipe`can be done using the special placeholder `.`as follows:
```{r Subsetting Tibbles with Pipes}
top_cartoons %>% .$cartoon_name
top_cartoons %>% .[["cartoon_name"]]
```

**NOTE**: tibbles never do partial matching and generate warnings if the column you are trying to access does not exist.  

#### Interacting with older code  

Some older functions (as `[`) don´t work with tibbles, in those cases use `as.data.frame()` to return a tibble back to a `data.frame`.  

`dplyr::filter()`and `dplyr::select()` do the same as the `[` function but with clearer code.  

**NOTE**: using `[` with tibbles always returns another tibble.  


Find the complete list of `tibble`settings with:  
```{r Tibble Settings, eval = FALSE}
package?tibble
```

## Data Import  

Most `readr` functions turn files into data frames.  

- `read_csv()`: reads comma delimited files.  

- `read_csv2()`: reads semicolon separated files.  

- `read_tsv()`: reads tab delimited files.  

- `read_delim`: reads in files with any delimiter.  

- `read_fwf()`: reads fixed width files.  

- `read_table()`: reads a common variation of fixed width files where columns are separated by white space.  

- `read_log()`: reads Apache style log files.  

Inline CSV files can be created with `read_csv()`:   
```{r Inline CSV}
read_csv("streaming_platform, monthly_price, pricing_year
Netflix, 8.99, 2021
Prime Video, 12.99, 2021
Disney+, 7.99, 2021")
```
When creating inline CSV files the first line of data is used as the column names.  

When there is metadata at the top of the file You can use `skip = n` to skip the first `n` lines; or use `comment = "#"` to drop all lines that start with (e.g.) `#`.  

```{r CSV files with Metadata}
read_csv("The first line of metadata
  The second line of metadata
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", skip = 2)

read_csv("# A comment I want to skip
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", comment = "#")
```

If the data does not have column names, use `col_names = FALSE` to label the first row sequentially from `X1` to `Xn`. Use the "\n" shortcut for adding a new line.     
```{r CSV without column names}
read_csv("1,2,3\n4,5,6", col_names = FALSE)
```
